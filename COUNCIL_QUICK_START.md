## 💡 Pro Tips

### Write Better Questions
✅ **Good**: "What's the best tech stack for a real-time collaboration app with 1000+ concurrent users?"
❌ **Bad**: "What's React?" (too simple)

✅ **Good**: "Should we open-source our AI training data considering IP and competitive risks?"
❌ **Bad**: "Write me a poem" (not a decision)

### Choose the Right Mode
- Simple question? → **Quick**
- Strategic decision? → **Deliberative**
- Moral dilemma? → **Ethical**
- Technical implementation? → **Builder**

### Pick the Right Model
- Complex questions: GPT-4, Claude-3-Opus, Llama-3-70B
- Simple questions: GPT-3.5, Claude-3-Haiku, Mistral
- Budget-conscious: Use Quick mode + smaller model

## 🎓 Understanding the Agents

### 🔬 The Analyst

## ⚠️ Common Issues

### Session Takes Too Long
- **Normal**: 1-3 minutes is expected
- **Fix**: Use Quick mode or faster model

### All Proposals Vetoed
- **Cause**: Strategist found all solutions unethical
- **Fix**: Reframe question to allow ethical options
- **Example**: "How to hack X?" → "How to secure X?"

### Low Consensus Score
- **Not always bad**: Indicates genuine complexity
- **Action**: Read minority notes carefully
- **Consider**: Maybe there's no single "right" answer

### Model Doesn't Support Council
- **Symptom**: Errors or poor responses
- **Fix**: Use models that support system prompts (GPT-4, Claude, Llama)
